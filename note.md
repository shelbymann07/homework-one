Homework note
=======================

I made a couple "asdjfklasdjf" comments when trying to make my stuff commit and I wasn't sure if it was working properly, so that was my frustrated typing to see if it would actually commit. All "scrambles" are from pre-class commits. 
And then I did commits during class to make sure I could "commit" everything to memory properly. :D yay punz.
